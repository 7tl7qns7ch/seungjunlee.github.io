# AI Researcher

### Research Interests
My research goal is to develop artificial general intelligence having the ability to think in a scientific way. 
It is common in fields of science and engineering that a well-established governing rule can explain similar phenomena, not just fitting on data from a narrow domain. 
Therefore, it is more scientifically important, and at the same time very challenging, to develop a general model that can explain many related phenomena rather than a narrow model. 
In the field of machine learning, such discussions are considered very important problems, and I am enthusiastic about the study of approaching and applying learning-based models and algorithms from a scientific modeling perspective.
