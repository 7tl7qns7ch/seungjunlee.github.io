### Research Interests & Goal
- **Scientific machine learning**
- **Physics-informed neural networks**
- **Generalization**
- **Artificial general intelligence**

My research goal is to develop artificial general intelligence having the ability to think in a scientific way. 
It is common in fields of science and engineering that a well-established governing rule can explain similar phenomena, not just fitting on data from a narrow domain. 
Therefore, it is more scientifically important, and at the same time very challenging, to develop a general model that can explain many related phenomena rather than a narrow model. 
In the field of machine learning, such discussions are considered very important problems, and I am enthusiastic about the study of approaching and applying learning-based models and algorithms from a scientific modeling perspective.

### Research Approach
Here is an example of my research approach to achieve my research goal. Scientists have established a wave equation (model) to describe the sound that is made when a string is plucked. Even if the physical properties of the string, such as its thickness or length, change, the wave equation can still explain related phenomena, with only the parameters of the equation changing. Especially, with a small amount of data available for a new string (such as its position over time), the frequencies of the sound produced by the new string can be predicted. In addition, the new wave can be explained by the same equation through appropriate transformations (encoding/projection) from raw data, even if the medium (domain) changes, such as a string,
water, air, or a metal plate. Furthermore, the wave equation can mathematically predict the various characteristics of general waves (such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference), and this has been proven through the experience or experiments of many people, and it has been established as a very reliable model for explaining general waves. Therefore, it is scientifically more important to make a general model that can explain general waves, rather than a narrow model that is only suitable for sound produced by one instance of string. In the field of machine learning, similar discussions are also very important. I am researching and applying machine learning models and algorithms from a scientific modeling perspective.
